# Particle Fun House

This project creates a config-driven environment for exploring generative art using particle systems. It's built in Rust on top of Nannou.

Docs are under construction.

## Possible Improvements:

- [ ] Kill particles on exit of window
- [ ] Other types of noise fields
- [ ] Repellers & Attractors
- [x] Validate simple physics
- [ ] Different types of randomizers
- [ ] Color shifter (different from color picker; shift color according to, say, life_span)
- [x] Config file passed on command line. Default to no config (to test defaults)
- [ ] UI for dragging emitters around and recording positions
